Our project aims to prepare **numerical ocean models** for the next generation [Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service](http://marine.copernicus.eu/) (CMEMS). 

In response to the future priorities for CMEMS, IMMERSE will develop new capabilities to:

 - enable the production of ocean forecasts and analyses that exploit upcoming **high resolution satellite datasets**;
 - deliver ocean analyses and forecasts with the **higher spatial resolution** and additional **process complexity** demanded by users;
 - exploit the opportunities of new **high performance computing (HPC) technology**;
 - allow **easy interfacing of CMEMS products** with detailed local coastal models.

These developments will be delivered in the **[NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) ocean model**, an established, world-class ocean modelling system that already forms the basis of the majority of CMEMS analysis and forecast products.
